# mebi-neo-11ty

11ty'd version of my website on [Neocities](https://afellowu.neocities.org/).

This is where I'm working on a new site layout for my website.

Feel free to use the code here as a reference. Do note that not all code here is mine.

For the original non-11ty site, visit [here](https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/mebi-neocities).

Found anything wrong with the website? Like accessibility or missing things? You can let me know [here](https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/mebi-neo-11ty/pulls).

Or if you want, you can [contribute](https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/mebi-neo-11ty/pulls) to the site.
