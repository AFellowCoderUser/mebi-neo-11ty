# mebi-neo-11ty

11ty'd version of my website on [Neocities](https://afellowu.neocities.org/).

This is where I'm working on a new site layout for my website.

Feel free to use the code here as a reference. Do note that not all code here is mine.

For the original non-11ty site, visit [here](https://github.com/AFellowCoderUser/mebi-neocities).

You may have noticed there is a separate repo named "mebi-neo-11ty-pract", well I forgot that repo branches existed :P but whatever
