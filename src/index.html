        <h1>Welcome to Mebi County!</h1>
        <p>Greetings, traveler. This is my place where I'll talk about and share my stuff here and other things. Venture around in this here county, and I hoep you'll feel cozy.</p>

        <p>I've been programming since 2020, first starting with Lua. It was not until 2023 when I started on HTML and CSS after seeing a Tumblr post that led to Neocities. Now, I just enjoy maintaining my website and adding more stuff.</p>

        <p>Most of the site's code here is written by me. Feel free to use the code to help you make your own website! However, I don't want to see retextured copies of my website.</p>
