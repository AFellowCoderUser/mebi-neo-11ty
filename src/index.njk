        <h1>Welcome to Mebi County!</h1>
        <p>Greetings, traveler. This is my place where I'll talk about and share my stuff here and other things. Venture around in this here county, and I hope you'll feel cozy.</p>

        <p>I've been programming since 2015, first starting off with Scratch. Around 2020-2021 is when I started to learn Lua. It was not until 2023 when I started learning HTML and CSS after seeing a Tumblr post that led to Neocities. Now, I just enjoy maintaining my website and adding more stuff.</p>

        <p>Most of the site's code here is written by me. Feel free to use the code to help you make your own website! I know you can do it!</p>
