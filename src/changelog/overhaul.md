- Well, that took a while but now the entire site has been converted to 11ty!
    - New site layout as well! More styles and decoration will be added later sometime.
    - OCs page redone, although I'm not really satisfied with the current design. 
- Blog page added! Finally, a place where I can let out some thoughts from my head.
- Gallery has been improved with [EZ Gallery](https://netfriend.neocities.org/ez-gallery/)!
    - I'll need to find a way to add descriptions to each image.
- Added more sites to the Sites page!
